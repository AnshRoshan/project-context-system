# Teams and Growth (v2.3)

## TL;DR
- Goal: ten people on ten branches share one wiki without negotiation; hot files stay small forever.

## What to build
references/multi-user.md playbook; lint catches duplicate Feature ids per section (ERROR), duplicate spec numbers (WARN); `task add --spec` refuses claimed numbers; `ctx archive` rotates log/tracker into dated archive files with pointers; neutral (lineage-free) copied CLI header.

## Explicitly NOT in this spec
Per-user tracker files; server-side merge tooling.

## Clarifications
User: "10 people working on 10 features… know when to move into another file… archive or dated folder".

## Verification checklist
- [x] two-branch collision simulation ends in a lint ERROR with an actionable fix
- [x] archive moves old entries, keeps them greppable, leaves pointers (test)
- [x] nothing deleted by archive (test asserts content lands in archive)
- [x] context pages updated (ctx impact shows no ✗)
